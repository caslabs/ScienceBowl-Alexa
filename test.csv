 be varied without changing the cancelation of gravity by the electrostatic repulsion?  
  W) The mass of the sphere  
 X) The 
radius of the sphere
   Y) The charge of the sphere  
 Z) The strength of the electric field produced by the table
  ANSWER: X)

    A student is working up a reaction and discovers, via thin layer 
chromatography on a silica plate, that there are many side products in her reaction mixture. The student 
decides to use column chromato
graphy on her reaction mixture, using the same mobile phase as she did for 
her TLC plate. What stationary phase should she use in order to keep the conditions as similar as possible to 
the TLC plate?
